Installing YOGA
===============

From PyPI
---------

To install YOGA from PyPI, just run the following command (as ``root`` on Linux)::

    pip3 install yoga

.. NOTE::

    We provide precompiled YOGA packages for most common platforms. You may need to install additional build dependencies if there is no precompiled package available for your platform (see below).


From Sources
------------

To install YOGA from sources, you will have to install some build dependencies first.

On DebianÂ / Ubuntu, you can install everything you need using the following command::

   sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools

Then clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/wanadev/yoga.git

Go to the project's directory::

    cd yoga

Get the submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Build and install using the following command (as ``root`` on Linux)::

    python3 setup.py install
