Pull Requests
-------------

Please consider `filing a bug <https://github.com/wanadev/yoga/issues>`_
before starting to work on a new feature. This will allow us to discuss the
best way to do it. This is, of course, not necessary if you just want to fix
some typo in the documentation or small errors in the code.

Please note that your code must pass tests and follow the coding style defined
by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org/>`_.


Running the Tests
-----------------

You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::

    pip3 install nox

Then you can check for lint error::

    nox --session lint

or run the tests::

    nox --session test

To run the tests only for a specific Python version, you can use following
commands (the corresponding Python interpreter must be installed on your
machine)::

    nox --session test-2.7
    nox --session test-3.5
    nox --session test-3.6
    nox --session test-3.7
    nox --session test-3.8
    nox --session test-3.9


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::

    pip3 install nox

Then you can run the following command::
